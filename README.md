# Measure-Size-and-Distance-of-an-Object-Using-OpenCV-Python-
Enhance projects with Python OpenCV for precise object size and distance measurements, using advanced computer vision techniques for accurate spatial calculations.
Measurement of Object Size and Distance

This project demonstrates how to measure the size of an object and the distance between the camera and the object using computer vision techniques. The project leverages OpenCV for image processing and calculations.

Introduction

This project provides a method to calculate the physical size of an object and the distance from the camera to the object using images. It uses OpenCV to process the image and apply geometric principles to perform the measurements. This can be useful in various applications, including robotics, augmented reality, and industrial measurements.

Features

- Measure the width and height of an object in an image.
- Calculate the distance from the camera to the object.
- Easy to use and integrate into other projects.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone 

2. Install the required packages:

Usage

1. Prepare your image: Ensure you have an image with a reference object of known size.

2. Run the script: Use the projectMeasure.py script to measure the size of an object and its distance from the camera.

    - --image: Path to the input image.
    - --width: Known width of the reference object in the image (in real-world units).
